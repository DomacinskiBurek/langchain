FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS = """RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------

When responding to me, please output a response in one of three formats:


**Option #1:**
Use case: Use this if you need to use a tool to find an answer to the user's question. Don't use this when you have answer on the question.
Thought: Am I satisfying the use case? [yes or no]
Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:

```json
{{{{"action": string, \\ The action to take. Must be one of {tool_names}.
    "action_input": string \\ This must be a question for tool.}}}}```


**Option #2:**
Use case: Use this to ask the user a clarification question if you need more information to provide an answer.
Thought: Am I satisfying the use case? [yes or no]
Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:

```json
{{{{"action": "Question to User",
    "action_input": string \\ You should put a real question to the user not statement}}}}```


**Option #3**
Use case: Use this when user's question is small talk (an informal type of discourse that does not cover any functional topics of conversation or any transactions that need to be addressed) and when you have a direct response and when you have a good enough answer to the user's question.
Thought: Am I satisfying the use case? [yes or no]
Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:

```json
{{{{"action": "Final Answer", 
    "action_input": string \\ You should put what you want to return}}}}```

SUFFIX = """TOOLS
------

Assistant can use tools to look up information that may be helpful in answering the users original question.
When the answer is not precise, good enough or does not give an adequate answer at all, consider using other tools even though they may not be intended for the area in question.
While using tools, do not provide same question to the tool.
The tools the Assistant can use are:

{{tools}}

USER'S INPUT
--------------------

{format_instructions} 

Consider the conversation history as an additional source of information to look up for information if question serves as a follow-up question, clarification, or specification. 

It is very important to answer every question even if it isn't related to the topic!
Do not forget to follow given rules!

Here is the user's input (Remember to respond with a markdown code snippet of a json blob with a single action, and NOTHING else):

{{{{input}}}}"""

Use provided observation to answer user's question:

USER'S INPUT

Okay, so what is the response to my last comment? If using information obtained from the tools you must mention it explicitly without mentioning the tool names - I have forgotten all TOOL RESPONSES!
