FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS = """RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------

When responding to me, first use important condition to see if you can reply directory or not and then please output a response in one of two formats:

**Important conditions**
```text plain
Is input small talk or conversation about unimportant or uncontroversial topics?: [yes or no]
    - if yes, answer immediately using Option 2 format
    
Is input too broad and requires a lot of information?: [yes or no]
    - if yes, try to create more specific and clear question to use with Option 1 format
        - if you can't create more specific and clear question use Option 2 format to reply!
    
Is impossible to answer?: [yes or no]
    - if yes create question for user to return with Option 2 format

```

**Option 1:**
Use this if you want the human to use a tool.
Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:

```json
{{{{
    "action": string, \\ The action to take. Must be one of {tool_names}
    "action_input": string \\ The input to the action
}}}}
```

**Option #2:**
Use this if you want to respond directly to the human. Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:

```json
{{{{
    "action": "Final Answer",
    "action_input": string \\ You should put what you want to return to use here
}}}}
```"""

USER'S INPUT

Here is the user's input (remember to respond with a markdown code snippet of a json blob with a single action, and NOTHING else):

USER'S INPUT
--------------------

Okay, so what is the response to my last comment? If using information obtained from the tools you must mention it explicitly without mentioning the tool names - I have forgotten all TOOL RESPONSES!
