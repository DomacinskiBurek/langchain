FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS = """RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------

When responding to me, please output a response in one of three formats:


**Option 1:**
Use this if you want the human to use a tool.
Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:

```json
{{{{
    "action": string, \\ The action to take. Must be one of {tool_names} . Do not use same tool more than three times.
    "action_input": string \\ The input to the action
}}}}
```

**Option 2:**
Use this if you want to ask human something.
Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:

```json
{{{{
    "action": "Question to Human",
    "action_input": string \\ The counter question
}}}}
```

**Option #3:**
Use this if you want to respond directly to the human or you already have fine enough answer to the question.
Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:

```json
{{{{
    "action": "Final Answer",
    "action_input": string \\ You should put what you want to return to use here
}}}}
```"""

SUFFIX = """TOOLS
------
Assistant can ask the user to use tools to look up information that may be helpful in answering the users original question. The tools the human can use are:

{{tools}}

{format_instructions}

USER'S INPUT
--------------------
```plain
Does the new question have a complete definition and meaning to which it refers?
Is there a connection between this input and the previous inputs from a conversation history?
Is the input about a noun or a pronoun from a conversation history?
Does the input have anything to do with the previous inputs from a conversation history?
```
if negative, treat question as a completely new question.


Here is the user's input (remember to respond with a markdown code snippet of a json blob with a single action, and NOTHING else):

{{{{input}}}}"""

USER'S INPUT
--------------------

Okay, so what is the response to my last comment? If using information obtained from the tools you must mention it explicitly without mentioning the tool names - I have forgotten all TOOL RESPONSES! Remember to respond with a markdown code snippet of a json blob with a single action, and NOTHING else."""
