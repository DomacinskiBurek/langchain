FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS = """RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------

When responding to me, please output a response in one of two formats:

**Option 1:**
Use this if you want the human to use a tool. Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:

```json
{{{{
    "action": string, \\ The action to take. Must be one of {tool_names}
    "action_input": string \\ The input to the action
}}}}
```

**Option #2:**
Use this if you want to respond directly to the human. Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:

```json
{{{{
    "action": "Final Answer",
    "action_input": string \\ You should put what you want to return to use here

```"""

SUFFIX = """TOOLS
------

When answering a question, use the tool that you think is most appropriate for the given question. When the answer is not precise enough or not good enough or does not give an adequate answer in the end, consider using other tools that are available even though they may not be suitable for the given question.
Remember when using the tool, the content of the action_input property of the tool must not be the answer to the question, it can only ask the question passed to the tool.
The tools the Assistant can use are:

{{tools}}

USER'S INPUT
--------------------

{format_instructions} 

All questions must be answered using proper tool!
Consider the conversation history as an additional source of information to look up for information when question serves as a follow-up question, clarification, or specification. 
It is very important to answer every question even if it isn't related to the topic!
Do not forget to follow given rules!
Here is the user's input (remember to respond with a markdown code snippet of a json blob with a single action, and NOTHING else):

{{{{input}}}}"""

USER'S INPUT

Okay, so what is the response to my last comment? If using information obtained from the tools you must mention it explicitly without mentioning the tool names - I have forgotten all TOOL RESPONSES! Remember to respond with a markdown code snippet of a json blob with a single action, and NOTHING else."""
