TOOLS:

"""
FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS = """
In order to use the tools, the question must be specific and direct. 
There must be no ambiguity in the question itself. 
Ambiguities can be resolved by using a saved previous conversation. 

To use tool, you MUST use format:

```
declare variable:
    negative=0
    positive=0

conditions:
    "Is input too broad and requires a lot of information?": [yes or no]
        * if yes, increment negative variable for one
        * if no, increment positive variable for one
        
    "Is possible to answer?": [yes or no]
        * if yes, increment positive variable for one
        * if no, increment negative variable for one

Thought: Do I need to use a tool? [(positive > negative) ? Yes : No]
Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action  
```

When you have a response to say to the Human, or if you do not need to use a tool, you MUST use the format:

```
Thought: Do I need to use a tool? No
{ai_prefix}: [your response here]
```"""

SUFFIX = """Begin!

Remember to respond with a markdown code snippet of a json blob with a single action, and NOTHING else.

Previous conversation history:

New input: {input}
